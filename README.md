Goal:
1) to split the data into different dataframes for male and female
     i. find correlation for both gender b/w height and weight
     ii. Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In the context of this project, linear regression can be used to model the relationship between a person's weight (dependent variable) and their height (independent variable).
     In this find relation via getting eq and visualization
     iii)use regression eq to predict ideal weight for particular height for both males and females

2) use logistic regression to predict/classify gender based on weight and height provided
